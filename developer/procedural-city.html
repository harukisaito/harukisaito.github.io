                This is a city that can be procedurally created and was the foundation of another project about 
                visualization of geographical data. I modeled some buildings in Unity with the ProBuilder Package and 
                then spawned them inside a "block". 
                These blocks were then spawned on a bigger grid to make up this city.
                The size of the blocks and the grid can be manipulated freely to make the city as big as one wants to 
                or the computer can handle.
