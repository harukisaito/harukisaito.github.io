            This is a city that can be procedurally created and was the foundation of another project about 
            visualization of geographical data. I modeled some buildings in Unity with the ProBuilder Package and 
            then spawned them inside a "block". 
            These blocks were then spawned on a bigger grid to make up this city.
            The size of the blocks and the grid can be manipulated freely to make the city as big as one wants to 
            or the computer can handle.

            The other project was about having a distorted view onto a point inside in this example New York City.
            Meaning that you can recognize the buildings inside New York 
            but can also see the coastline of East America.
