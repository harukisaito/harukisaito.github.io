            This project was simply about showing off the solar system in a simulation.
            I just had some scripts so you could input all the data necessary to accurately display the rotation
            of the planets around the sun, the moons around the planets and so on. 
            The hardest part about this was to make it visually pleasing as the planets are so small and
            so far away from each other that you could not see what was going on.
