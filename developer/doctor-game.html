            This Project was about making my own game to have something original to show off. 
            I would do both the coding and designing of the game because I like both.
            The concept of the game was that the player was an old school plague doctor who would fight against viruses and bacteria. 
            The longer I worked on this game the more I started to doubt my concept and wanted to quit.
            Everything started to make no sense and there were some flaws with the concept and how I implemented it.
            There should have been more prototypes before investing into this one game but I finished it somehow.
