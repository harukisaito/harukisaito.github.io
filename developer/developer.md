# As an developer

I had no prior knowledge about programming before I started here and had little to no interest in it. My Journey started with the basics of the C# language where I built my first ever program inside the console. It was a "simulation" of a city in which there were humans and pets who could eat, work, do sports and have fun. It was about managing ones energy levels while earning money, staying healthy and keeping the pet happy. This is where I learned everything about classes, inheritance and much more about Object Oriented Programming.

# Unity

I started learning Unity in the beginning of 2019. Starting small with the official Unity Tutorials like "Roll A Ball" and a remake of "Flappy Bird".

## Space Invaders

This is the first game I made by myselft with Unity! I wanted to start small with a 2D game and decided to make an old school classic, Space Invaders!

I got it done somehow but if I think about it now the game is an absolute mess. It took me about two weeks to finish this.

## Super Mario

After finishing Space Invaders, I thought about making Super Mario next as I had a lot of childhood memories connected to that game. Me, being the inexperienced developer that I was at that time, thought that it would be pretty easy to make because it seemed so simple. Boy, oh boy was I wrong.

This Project took me about a month and this was only the first level. The way I programmed it, wasn't as modular so doing the next level would have taken quite some time.

## Solar System

After making these two games, I wanted to do something else so I decided to do a simulation of our solar system. I loved how something so "simple" could look so beautiful. I got the textures from the planets and just started making a planet rotating around the sun. The base code of this project was on the smaller side but was loaded with some math. (Quaternions still confuse me to this day)

## My own game - "Doctor"

I've gathered quite some experience about Unity at this point so I thought I would make my own game. The concept of the game was that the player was an old school plague doctor who would fight against viruses and bacteria. It was supposed to be a 2D jump and run game. The game did not come out the way I wanted it to and I finished after only making one level. The concept was not well thought out and there should have been more prototypes before investing into one game. I also did all of the artworks and animations of the game as it should have shown off what I can do with Unity as a developer and as an "artist".

## Procedural City

As I was working on a side project, I needed a city which can serve as a foundation of a map. So I built this simple script to generate me a city as big as I want to.
