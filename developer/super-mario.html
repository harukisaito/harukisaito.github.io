            Here in this project I wanted to recreate one of my childhood favorites, "Super Mario". 
            I just downloaded all of the sprite-sheets that I needed and started with the code base.
            The game itself looks so simple but is so complex if done properly. 
            Obviously it doesn't compare to the latest releases though.
