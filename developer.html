            I had no prior knowledge about programming before I started here and had little to no interest in it. 
            My Journey started with the basics of the C# language where I built my first ever program inside the console. 
            It was a "simulation" of a city in which there were humans and pets who could eat, work, do sports and have fun. 
            It was about managing ones energy levels while earning money, staying healthy and keeping the pet happy. 
            This is where I learned everything about classes, inheritance and much more about Object Oriented Programming.
