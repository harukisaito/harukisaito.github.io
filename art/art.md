# As an artist
I am self thaught and nowhere near professional level. I am just showcasing what I did up to this point.

## Traditional Drawings
This is the medium that I am most familiar with, pencil and paper. Before starting my internship at [ART+COM](https://artcom.de/) I didn't even consider trying out a drawing tablet.

## Animation
I wanted to try out some animation as I got more confortable with the drawing tablet.

## Digital Drawings
I also wanted to try playing with colors so I started doing that.
